# Rust is a big language. We don't have time for:

- syntax
- enums (tagged unions) and Option
- error handling with Result and ?
- generics (templates) and traits
- unsafe code
- extern and interoperating with C
- Cargo

# Instead, we're going to focus on three big ideas:
- references
- mutable aliasing
- move semantics


# Visualizing Memory Layout of Rust's data types
